# About me
Fascinated by the insights data can reveal, I’m driven to harness its power to solve real-world challenges in healthcare, education, and agriculture. With a background in Biomedical Engineering, I’m actively exploring how machine learning and large language models can transform healthcare outcomes and improve decision-making processes.

In parallel, I bring strong skills in client communication, automation design, and business process optimization. My UiPath RPA Associate Certification and hands-on projects have equipped me to build scalable bots, integrate APIs, handle exceptions, and streamline workflows — creating secure, reliable automations that drive business growth.

I’m passionate about using technology to make meaningful impact. Feel free to reach out and let's do great stuff great together.
